# Vercel Scaling Fix Implementation

## Problem

The portfolio website was experiencing scaling issues on Vercel deployment where fonts and elements appeared larger than expected on mobile devices, while working perfectly on localhost.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by aggressive CSS overrides and zoom controls that were conflicting with Vercel's production environment rendering behavior.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Viewport Meta Tag

- Removed: `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, shrink-to-fit=no`
- Kept: `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`
- Added mobile web app meta tags for better iOS/Android support

### 2. Cleaned Up CSS

- Removed all `!important` declarations on zoom and transform properties
- Removed aggressive scaling prevention CSS
- Simplified font-size declarations
- Maintained text-size-adjust properties for cross-platform consistency

### 3. Removed JavaScript Zoom Prevention

- Eliminated all gesture event listeners
- Removed devicePixelRatio manipulation
- Removed runtime viewport manipulation

### 4. Simplified React Component

- Removed useEffect scaling controls
- Removed inline styles with zoom/transform properties
- Kept clean, semantic structure

### 5. Updated Vercel Configuration

- Enhanced headers for better caching and security
- Added proper cache control headers
- Maintained SPA routing configuration
